Travels with Paul
Photos of some the places I have been luckily enough to have traveled to. 
www.travelswithpaul.co.uk 
The purpose of these files is to give someone a hint as to what constitutes this site.
This project does not yet contain all the photos necessary to make a complete build nor the database files to create and 
populate the MySQL tables.

There are links to several plugins notably: flexslider by WooThemes; jMyCarousel by enova-tech; lightbox by Lokesh Dhakar;
To which I am eternally grateful.

These files have been slightly modified by myself to suite this site.
